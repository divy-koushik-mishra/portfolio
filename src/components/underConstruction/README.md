# Under Construction Components

## Overview
These components provide a consistent way to display "under construction" messages throughout your portfolio, following the exact same design patterns and styling.

## Components

### 1. UnderConstruction (Full Version)
**File**: `UnderConstruction.tsx`  
**Usage**: Full-page under construction with detailed information, progress bars, and features list.

**Features**:
- ðŸš§ Construction header with emoji
- Detailed explanation of what's coming
- Progress bars showing development status
- Consistent with portfolio design system
- Mobile responsive
- Uses diagonal line gradients

**Example Usage**:
```tsx
import { UnderConstruction } from '@/components/underConstruction'

const MyPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <UnderConstruction />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. CompactUnderConstruction (Inline Version)
**File**: `compact.tsx`  
**Usage**: Compact version for inline use in other components or sections.

**Features**:

import { CompactUnderConstruction } from '@/components/underConstruction'

const MySection = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>My Section</h2>
      <CompactUnderConstruction />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Design Consistency

Both components follow your portfolio's design system:

- **Borders**: Uses `border-border` class for consistent border styling
- **Typography**: Uses `font-mono` and your established text hierarchy
- **Colors**: Uses CSS custom properties (`text-foreground`, `text-foreground/80`, etc.)
- **Spacing**: Follows the same padding and margin patterns
- **Layout**: Uses the same `max-w-3xl` container and border structure
- **Components**: Integrates with `DiagonalLineGradientBgFull` for visual consistency

## When to Use

### Use UnderConstruction (Full) when:
- Creating a dedicated under-construction page

- Want to explain what's coming in detail
- Building a placeholder for a major section

### Use CompactUnderConstruction when:

- Need a simple placeholder
- Want minimal visual impact

## Customization

Both components are built with Tailwind CSS and can be easily customized:

- **Colors**: Modify the color classes to match your theme
- **Content**: Update the text content and progress percentages
- **Layout**: Adjust spacing and sizing as needed
- **Icons**: Replace emojis with custom icons or images
