      Hi, I’m <strong>Divy Koushik Mishra</strong> — a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>,
      <strong> founding team member</strong> at multiple startups, and an aspiring entrepreneur.
      I’m passionate about building scalable, impactful products that combine clean
      engineering, thoughtful design, and measurable business results.
    </p>

    <p>
      With hands-on experience in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>,
      <strong> React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>,
      <strong> FastAPI</strong>, and modern backend stacks like <strong>T3 Stack</strong>
      (Next.js App Router, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, NextAuth),
      I specialize in <strong>end-to-end product development</strong> — from writing the
      first line of code to deploying on <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Vercel</strong>,
      and <strong>Coolify</strong>. My experience spans <strong>database modeling</strong>,
      <strong>API design</strong>, <strong>mobile app development</strong> with React Native,
      <strong> system architecture</strong>, and <strong>DevOps</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve worked as the <strong>first technical hire</strong> at early-stage startups,
      building <strong>MVPs that secured VC funding</strong>, customer-facing applications,
      internal operations dashboards, and tools for licensed professionals. My projects
      often involve <strong>UI/UX design</strong>, <strong>performance optimization</strong>,
      <strong>cloud scaling</strong>, and <strong>data-driven improvements</strong> through
      A/B testing and analytics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of pure development, I’m exploring <strong>product management</strong>,
      <strong>personal branding</strong>, and <strong>content creation</strong>. I enjoy
      blending tech with creativity — whether it’s experimenting with <strong>cinematography</strong>
      on my DSLR, producing music in FL Studio, sketching, or diving into calligraphy.
      I’m also building <strong>FlipsideBrain</strong>, a productivity and self-growth
      platform with features like website blockers, browser activity tracking, and cross-device sync.
    </p>

    <p>
      My personal philosophy: treat life like an RPG — <strong>level up every day</strong>,
      acquire new skills, and create things that make a difference. Whether it’s software
      that scales to thousands of users or a small creative project, my goal is to ship
      high-quality, meaningful work.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re looking for a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> who can take an idea
      from concept to launch, lead technical execution, and align it with business goals,
      let’s connect and build something remarkable together.
